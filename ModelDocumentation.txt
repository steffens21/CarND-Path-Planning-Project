Model Documentation for Path Planning Project
---------------------------------------------

My submitted solution re-uses the provided project walk-through in large parts.  
The main difference being that I use an FST to decide the target lane and the target 
speed.

Some details:

1) In each step we re-use the full previous path which has not yet been travelled.

2) To decide the target lane and the target speed we use an FST which takes as input:
	- The car's s, d, and the yaw in (s, d)-coordinates
	- The postion of all other cars
	- The current speed
   Essentially the FST determines first if we are already in the process of changing
   lanes by looking at the current yaw.  If we are in the process of changing lanes we
   just keep on with that process and don't accelerate.
   
   If we are not in the process of changing lanes we first check wether we can keep
   driving in our lane by checking if we get too close to any other car in doing so.
   If it's possible to stay in our lane we do that.  If we would come too close to
   another car, we check whether changing lanes is feasible.  If so, we do it.
   If no lane allows us to travel at the curent speed we slow down a bit.
   
   We also try to avoid lane changes when the car is very slow.
   
3) Once we decided on target lane and target speed we use the spline trick from the 
   project walkthrough to generate a smooth path
   
General notes:
I struggled for weeks with getting a no jerky trajectory and was only saved by the project
 walkthrough.  Even though the project introduction mentioned splines it was totally
 not obvious to me where to apply them.  I tried and failed to apply them in various
 ways ...
I also know it would have been nicer not to use an FST but instead, generated some random
 paths and use cost functions to pick the best one.  But given how much time I struggled
 with this project I simply wanted to get done and move on in the course.
