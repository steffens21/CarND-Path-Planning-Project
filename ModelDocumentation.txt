Model Documentation for Path Planning Project
---------------------------------------------

My submitted solution re-uses the provided project walk-through in large parts.  
The main difference being that I use an FST to decide the target lane and the target 
speed.

Some details:

1) In each step we re-use the full previous path which has not yet been travelled.

2) To decide the target lane and the target speed we use an FST which takes as input:
	- The car's state
	- The postion of all other cars
	- The current speed
   The FST prefers driving in the middle lane.  Otherwise we check if driving in current lane 
   is feasible.  Otherwise we check if a lane change is possible.
   If all checks fail we slow down the car.
   
3) Once we decided on target lane and target speed we use the spline trick from the 
   project walkthrough to generate a smooth path
