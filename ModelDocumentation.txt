Model Documentation for Path Planning Project
---------------------------------------------

My submitted solution re-uses the provided project walk-through in large parts.  
The main difference being that I use an FST to decide the target lane and the target 
speed.

Some details:

1) In each step we re-use the full previous path which has not yet been travelled.

2) To decide the target lan and the target speed I use an FST which takes as input:
	- The car's s, d, and the yaw in (s, d)-coordinates
